# CloudSimSC: A Toolkit for Modeling and Simulation of Serverless Computing Environments #

CloudSimSC: A modular extension to CloudSim, a simulator for modeling cloud environments

Serverless computing is gaining traction as an attractive model for the deployment of a multitude of workloads in the cloud. Designing and building effective resource management solutions for any computing environment requires extensive long term testing, experimentation and analysis of the achieved performance metrics. Utilizing real test beds and serverless platforms for such experimentation work is often times not possible due to resource, time and cost constraints. Thus, employing simulators to model these environments is key to overcoming the challenge of examining the viability of such novel ideas for resource management. To this end,  we have developed a serverless simulation model with flexibility in its architecture to adopt to various existing serverless platforms along with features for request load balancing, function scheduling and scaling.



CloudSimSC is developed in [the Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems (CLOUDS) Laboratory](http://cloudbus.org/), at [the School of Computing and Information Systems](http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/) of [the University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/).



# Main features #

  * A generalized architecture for function execution following both the existing commercial and open-source serverless architectures, allowing the users to choose depending on the environment that needs to be replicated
  * Functional components for request load balancing, function scheduling and scaling (horizontal and vertical)
  * Facilitates the introduction of custom function load balancing, scheduling and scaling policies
  * Ability to derive monitoring metrics with regard to application performance, system throughput and the underlying resource consumption for infrastructure providers
